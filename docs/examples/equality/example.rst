==========================
Comparing two declarations
==========================

This example shows how two declarations can be compared.

Let's consider the following c++ file (example.hpp):

.. literalinclude:: example.hpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 4-

The following code will show you how to search for two functions, using
different ways. Both declarations are then compared.

.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 5,6,7,16-26,28-
