Variables
=========

This example shows how to find variables and find information about them.

Let's consider the following c++ file:

.. literalinclude:: example.hpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 4-

The following code can be use to find the variable named "c" using different
strategies, and to print information about it:

.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 5,6,7,16-26,28-
