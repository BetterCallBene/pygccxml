============
Nested types
============

This example shows how to work with types.

Let's consider the following c++ file:

.. literalinclude:: example.hpp
   :language: c++
   :lines: 4-

The following code allows you to extract information about the types of variables:

.. literalinclude:: example.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 5,6,7,16-26,28-
